Part A

 

My solution was to send the string to UART_OutString which then sent it to UART_OutChar one character at a time

 

Part B

unsigned char String[10]; is local to the UART.c file not global, you store the result of your conversion in String. UART_OutUDec calls your conversion function then calls UART_OutString to print String

 

Part C

The same as part B store your result in String, UART_OutDistance calls your distance conversion function then also calls UART_OutString to print String

 

Hope that is of some help
